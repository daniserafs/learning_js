# learning_js
some of my notes on learning JavaScript. Feel free to correct me any time.

# how these files are connected

The file scripts.html is connected to scripts.js, every time I'm trying to test a js file I open scripts.html on my browser to test wheather or not it's working. I also use scripts.js for new skills and after I'm done coding it, I make a new .js file with the name of the skill, i.e.: array.js for when I was learning how array works in JavaScript.
Most part of the time the scripts.js file will be empty.
